## What is this?

This is an app I had in the iOS app store that started as a basic pace calculator and grew to be a workout log and calorie calculator as well. The calorie calculations are from a prominent sports medicine text and were surprisingly hard to come by online (ended up buying a hard copy to locate the right equations and research).

## Language

Old school baby, this was coded in Objective C and the 1.0 even had that horrendous memory management code before Apple automated memory management. Refactored since then. Someday I'll re-write this thing in Swift with Storyboards - will probably take all of 4 hours now.
